# led-matrix-animation
Led matrix animation in arduino code for 4 cascaded matrices with drivers. It represents a man walking and shooting another man.

The project was developed using Arduino IDE and Arduino Nano Every board but shoul work fine for every other Arduino or similar board.
Make sure you read the wiring scheme and as always let me know if you would improve anything.

I also uploaded a video that shows the animation.
